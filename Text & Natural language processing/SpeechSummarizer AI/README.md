# SpeechSummarizer AI

**SpeechSummarizer AI** is an advanced Python project designed to demonstrate automated text extraction, summarization, and multilingual translation of speeches using state-of-the-art AI models.  

This project was developed to showcase applied skills in:

- Large language models (OpenAI GPT)
- LangChain prompt engineering
- PDF parsing and text preprocessing
- Chunk-based summarization (Map-Reduce strategy)
- Natural language translation
- Clean, reproducible, professional-grade Python workflows
