Machine Learning Projects Portfolio üìäüí°

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! This repository showcases various machine learning projects that I have worked on during my master‚Äôs studies in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Each project highlights different aspects of ML, such as data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and deployment techniques. The projects cover a range of topics from supervised and unsupervised learning to more specialized areas like natural language processing and deep learning.
üìÅ Repository Contents

    Classification Models: Projects involving classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and K-nearest neighbors, applied to real-world datasets.
    Regression Analysis: Models for predicting continuous outcomes, using techniques like linear regression, support vector regression, and ensemble methods.
    Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction: Projects focusing on unsupervised learning methods for grouping data, such as K-means clustering and PCA.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text processing and analysis projects using NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
    Deep Learning: Neural network projects exploring image recognition, sequence prediction, and other applications using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
